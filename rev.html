                            <h1>X-Men Apocalypse REVIEW</h1>
                            <img src="images/imgx.jpg" />
                            <h6><h2>Apocalypse
 includes everything you’d want in an X-Men movie, including two of the 
best superhero set-pieces ever. But after Days Of Future Past, it feels a
 tad underwhelming, and even a little tired. 	Over
 the last 16 years, Bryan Singer has established himself as the 
quintessential superhero director. Yes, even more so than Christopher 
Nolan, Sam Raimi, and any of Kevin Feige’s cronies, as he has been able 
to combine gravitas with subtle themes that rise to prominence in the <i>X-Men</i> saga, all in an entertaining, ambitious and truly cinematic style.&nbsp;</h2><br>
2000’s <em>X-Men</em> and 2003’s <em>X2</em> helped to both legitimize and kick-start the comic-book boom, while 2014’s <em>X-Men: Days Of Future Past</em> eclipsed both of them and is right up there as one of the finest ever entries to the genre.&nbsp;So when I say that <em>X-Men: Apocalypse</em> is Singer's worst effort in the series to date (but still obviously better than <em>Last Stand</em>, and even <em>First Class</em> or any of the <em>Wolverine</em> films), that’s only because of how scintillating his previous efforts were. <em>Apocalypse </em>is also still resoundingly entertaining. But it ultimately lacks the cohesion and energy of <em>Days Of Future Past. </em>It
 tries to juggle too many plots and subplots, including introducing us 
to younger versions of characters we’d previously met and adored over a 
decade ago. Plus, some of its apocalyptic action even brought on a touch
 of the dreaded superhero fatigue.<br><br><em>X-Men: Apocalypse</em> primarily takes place in 1983, but it begins 
in ancient Egypt where Oscar Isaac’s En Sabah Nur/Apocalypse, the 
world’s first mutant, looks to merge with Celestial technology to become
 even more powerful. His augmentation is sabotaged, though, which 
results in him being trapped for centuries.<br><br>
When Apocalypse finally is released from his slumber, he is disgusted by
 the world, acquires four followers, and sets out to change things. 
Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) has an issue with that, and alongside 
Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), and an array of younger X-Men, including 
Cyclops (Tye Sheridan), Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), Quicksilver (Evan 
Peters), and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee), he looks to stop them.As you’d expect from Bryan Singer and screenwriter Simon Kinberg, <em>Apocalypse</em>
 gets down to business in an economic, pacey and riveting fashion, 
establishing its titular villain, the new posse of younger superheroes, 
as well as the current plights of Magneto, Professor X, and Mystique, 
and setting up the conflicts that are about to unfold in a funny, 
compelling and eye-catching manner.<br><br>
But after its opening act, <em>Apocalypse </em>never pushes on or 
becomes more potent, with the sight of Oscar Issac’s Apocalypse 
traveling to pick up Olivia Munn’s Psylocke, Alexandra Shipp’s Storm, 
Ben Hardy’s Angel, and Michael Fassbender’s Magneto being more plodding 
rather than enthralling. Unfortunately, Isaac’s Apocalypse is similar to
 Tom Hardy’s Bane (rather than Heath Ledger’s Joker), as he’s just 
brawn, brute, monosyllabic and rather dull. Overwhelmed by make-up and 
his costume, Isaac is unable to deploy any of the personality, charisma,
 or complexity that has made him one of the most in-demand actors in 
American cinema, while the final sequence is too reminiscent of other 
battles from the series to strike a chord. There’s just too much 
grandstanding, and it feels like you’re watching a WWE stand-off.<br><br>
The established ensemble all excel, 
though, with Michael Fassbender giving Magneto a Shakespearian poise, 
while James McAvoy has never looked more comfortable as Professor X. The
 new additions merge into the world seamlessly, too, teasing that the 
franchise’s future is in safe hands. My only concern is that while 
Marvel have been able to, mostly, build their universe chronologically,&nbsp;<em>X-Men's</em>&nbsp;decision to go back in time with&nbsp;<em>First Class&nbsp;</em>means
 that the franchise is becoming convoluted. Not only are they 
re-treading old ground, but they're pushing the most engaging pair from 
the series, Charles Xavier and Magneto, more to the sidelines.&nbsp;<br style="line-height: 20.8px;"><br>
But there's still more than enough to make&nbsp;<em>X-Men: Apocalypse</em>&nbsp;captivating,
 as it features three scintillating action sequences that are right up 
there with the best the franchise has ever produced. The opening in 
Ancient Egypt is immediately rousing, while <em>Apocalypse</em> somehow manages to top <em>Days Of Future Past’s</em>
 Quicksilver set-piece, and I won’t go into the other in any detail 
whatsoever for fear of spoiling it. All I will say is it will have you 
leaping off your seat with joy.&nbsp;<br><br>
Along the way, Bryan Singer controls the camera in a smooth and silky 
manner, while including detailed human touches to the action and the 
X-Men’s use of their powers that get under your skin and are striking to
 see. Once again, he manages to combine the storytelling of the Marvel 
Cinematic Universe with the spectacle of DC, as he uses colors, 
silences, pans, and a mixture of intimate and grandiose framing to 
create a cinematic texture that's just intoxicating.<br><br>
But, after <em>Days Of Future Past</em>, you’ll be left feeling a little underwhelmed by <em>Apocalypse,</em>&nbsp;as&nbsp;there’s only so many times that you can watch the world being brought to the edge of obliteration. <em>X-Men: Apocalypse</em>
 still works and entertains, but not quite as emphatically as it 
predecessors, and it’s proof that bigger and louder is not all always 
better.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></h6>
